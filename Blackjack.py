#My blackjack code!

#Probably the best way to do it is to have a dictionary from 1 - 14
#with 11 being ace, 12 being Jack, 13 being Queen, 14 being King

#TO DO:
    # Give player two cards
    # Have 4 of each card, so if player or dealer gets one, they have less chance of getting same
    # Have "hit/stick" ability 
    
#LATER 
    # Have ability to bet!
